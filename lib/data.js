          "This restaurant is very picturesque. The sorrounding is relaxing, which makes it a great place to spend lunch with your boyfriend/girlfriend but also with your friends or family. The hausgemachte Limonade is fantastic. I tried the lemon one and it's very fresh and well done. Despite being a bit costly, the portion is big and satisfying. I suggest to take the Antipasti. The only down is the service, it could have been better. There were not enough cutlery and napkins for everyone.Ich kann es nur Empfehlen.",
